It was about 6:30 in the evening, and I started by turning on my gas oven and setting the temperature at 350 degree. As I was waiting for the temperature to rise in my oven, I took out two brown glass bowls. One bowl was a small brown bowl, while the other bowl was a larger brown bowl. After pulling the bowls out of my kitchen cabinets, I opened the refrigerator and pulled out 2 sticks of margarine and two different boxes of  chocolate cake mixes and I opened a bag of white chocolate chip cookies. For the first batch of cookies, I put opened one stick of margarine and placed it in the small bowl and microwaved it on 60 seconds. Unfortunately, about 40 seconds into the melting of the margarine, I heard a pop and the margarine had a slight explosion inside my microwave, which was easy to clean up. I pulled out the margarine and wiped out the microwave with a paper towel. Then I started working on making the cookies. First, I opened the blue box of chocolate cookie mix, which was the immaculate brand chocolate cake mix. I took the cake mix bag out of the box and cut it open with my white and red kitchen shears that are manufactured by Betty Crocker. After cutting the bag open, I poured the contents of the bag into the large brown glass bowl. I proceeded to dump the margarine into the bowl with the cake mix, stirred and then added one large egg that I cracked open on the side of the bowl and dumped the contents of the egg in the large brown bowl. I mixed the contents together with my small red spatula, that was made by Betty Crocker. After, mixing the ingredients together, I found that the batter was a little dry, so I added about 1/8 cup of applesauce to the mix. After adding the applesauce to he mix, it was the consistency that I was looking for, so I added 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips to the cookie batter and stirred with my red spatula. After, I got the consistency that I wanted, I put the bowl of batter into the refrigerator for approximately 5 minutes. While,  I was waiting for the batter to become cold, I took the largest Wilton silver baking sheet pans and lined it with parchment paper that I had ripped from the roll of parchment paper. Then after lining the pan, I took the bowl of cookie batter out of the refrigerator and sat it on the counter. Then, I proceeded to scoop out cookie batter with the ice cream scoop and placing the dough onto the parchment lined cookie sheet. The pan consisted of rows of 3 with a total of 5 rows of scooped cookie dough. Since, I had a little cookie dough left over, I pulled out my smallest Wilton pan and lined it with parchment paper and preceded to scoop out the remaining cookie dough from the bowl and placed the balls on the paper. Then I put the pans in the oven . The largest pan on the bottom oven rack and the small pan on the top oven rack. After closing the oven door, I set the timer for 10 minutes. While the cookies where in the oven. I started making my next batch of cookies.  /  / First, I took the same small bowl that I had melted the margarine in the first time and placed an unwrapped stick of margarine in the bowl. Put the bowl in the microwave and set the timer for 30 seconds. After the timer went off, I pulled out the bowl and stirred the margarine in order for it to be fully melted. I then, sat the bowl down and took the large bowl that I had used for the first batch of cookies to make the second batch. I took a box of Duncan Hines Triple Chocolate Cake Mix out of its box and only opened the bag that was just cake mix. I then preceded to dump the cake mix that I cut open with my cooking sheers and dumped it into the bowl. After, I dumped the contents of the margarine into the bowl with the chocolate cake mix. I stirred them together and then I added one egg to the batter and then stirred again. Afterwhich, I added about 1/8 cup of apple sauce, stirred and then added the contents of the second bag that was in the box. I stirred them together and then I added a Tablespoon more of applesauce and while I was stirring the timer on the oven went off. So, I dropped what I was doing and pulled out the cookies and they were not yet done, so I switched  the pans in the oven and set the timer on the oven for 5 more minutes. Then I went back to finishing, my other batch and put them in the refrigerator for 5 minutes. Afterwards, I lined two baking sheets one a Wilton medium baking pan and the other a bakers secret baking pan with parchment paper. I had a few minutes to wait on my batch that was in the oven, so I cleaned my counter of trash and then put my bowls in the sink. Then, I pulled out the bowl of batter from the refrigerator and placed on the counter. While doing so the buzzer on the oven went off, I opened the over and check to see if the cookies were down with my fingers tapping them slightly and they were not, so I closed the oven door and started to scoop the other cookies onto the trays and when I was finished I took the other cookies out of the oven and put in my second batch. I set the timer for 15 minutes, while I was waiting for the cookies to cool on the oven pan, I cleaned up my kitchen area. I then put the cookies from the cooking pans onto the cooling rack to cool. About 10 minutes into the baking process, I flipped the pans in the oven and waited for them to come out of the oven. When the 15 minutes was up the cookies were not done, so I putted them down with a spatula and put them in the oven for a few more minutes and then took them out of the oven to cool on the baking sheet. / ',\n",
